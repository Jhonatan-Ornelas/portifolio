                        <p>The security of your information is extremely important to us. We employ various measures to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline. Online, we utilize SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. This security protocol encrypts the information you send through our website to ensure that your transaction is secure. Offline, we implement multiple security measures in our physical data centers to safeguard against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information. Additionally, we limit access to personal information to employees who need it to perform their job functions. They are required to uphold the confidentiality of such information and face disciplinary penalties, including termination, if they fail to do so. If you have any questions or concerns about security, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
